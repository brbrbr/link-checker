2.3.0.6541
 # Do not display redirected link when the final url equals the original (for example with cookie redirects)
 # Convert punnycode url back to utf8
 - Removed safe mode checks
 ^ Started namespaces and use instead of all the includes
 ^ Changed order of columns in link overview. Makes more sence to have the anchor next to the source
2.3.0.6489
 - Removed the Link Suggestions. These are just links to archive.org. You can do better.
 - Removed the 'Check external links' advertisement from the settings menu.
 ^ Reworked the status display. Uses one single script (and request) for all updates of full statusses and the bubbles. Added option to show/hide the bubbles to the settings
 ^ Optimized link queries (EXISTS instead of JOIN (+GROUP BY), added table index to a frequently used column combination and some smaller tweaks). That should improve query time and therefor website performance.
 ^ replaced microtime_float with native microtime(true);
